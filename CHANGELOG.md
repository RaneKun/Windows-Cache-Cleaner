- **Fixed inconsistent returns** — All functions return `(success, failed, bytes)` (was: mixed return types)

#### Minor Fixes
- **Fixed window sizing** — Proper minimum/maximum constraints (was: could be resized too small)
- **Fixed close during cleanup** — Warns and confirms before closing (was: could accidentally close)
