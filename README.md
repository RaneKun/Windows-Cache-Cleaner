## 🛡️ Safety & Security

### What Makes This Tool Safe?

✅ **No Critical System Files** — Only cleans cache folders that Windows recreates automatically  
✅ **Admin Rights Required** — Ensures you're aware of what the tool is doing  
✅ **Detailed Tooltips** — Full transparency about what each option does  
✅ **Confirmation Dialogs** — Asks before making any changes  
✅ **Comprehensive Logging** — Everything is logged for review  
✅ **Open Source** — You can inspect the code yourself  

### Antivirus False Positives

**Note:** Some antivirus software may flag the `.exe` as suspicious. This is a **false positive** common with PyInstaller-built executables.

**Why this happens:**
- PyInstaller bundles the Python interpreter into the .exe
- This packaging method can resemble some malware packers
- The tool requires admin rights (which is flagged by heuristics)

**What you can do:**
- Check the source code yourself (it's fully available)
- Build the .exe yourself using the included build scripts
- Add the .exe to your antivirus whitelist
- Submit it to your antivirus vendor as a false positive
