# 🧹 Windows Cache Cleaner
A simple, safe, and no-nonsense tool to wipe out unnecessary cache files on Windows — without touching anything important.

This project includes both the **standalone EXE** and the **full Python source code**, so you can learn from it, tweak it, or extend it however you like.

Just don’t try to sell it or repost it without giving proper credit. 🙂

## 🚀 What This Tool Does
This cleaner targets only **safe-to-remove cache folders**, including:
- Windows Update leftover downloads
- Delivery Optimization cache
- Temporary folders from apps
- Thumbnail caches
- Log caches
- Other junk Windows recreates automatically

The goal: keep your PC clean, free up space, and reduce random slowdowns — without needing to dig into hidden folders yourself.
